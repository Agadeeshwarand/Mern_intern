        <h3>what is strictmode?</h3>

        <p>StrictMode is a development-only tool that identifies potential issues like deprecated lifecycle methods, improper useEffect usage, and side effects.
             It prepares your app for future features like concurrent rendering. 
             It has no impact on production and helps ensure robust, modern code.
